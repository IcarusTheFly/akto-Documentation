# API Traffic data connectors

Akto populates API inventory by connecting to your source of traffic. This source of traffic is called traffic connector. Akto has multiple traffic connectors for your needs. There are two types of traffic connectors:

1. Fully-automated connectors for self hosted plan
2. Semi- automated connectors for open-source and cloud plan
