# Test Library

Test Library is Akto’s library of built-in API security tests. These tests span OWAP TOP 10 of APIs, HackerOne Top 10 and all the new and critical API vulnerabilities.

Today we have the following test categories in our library, each one having multiple tests:

1. [Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)](https://www.akto.io/test-library/broken-object-level-authorization)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Our methodology of building test library:** We are building the test library keeping in mind the needs of our users. Our users care about covering OWASP Top 10 of APIs and all the new critical vulnerabilities. Additionally, if we see our users creating custom tests that are also valuable for other members, we add those tests to our test library and make it available to everyone.
