# Roles

If you have role-based access control in your APIs and application, you would want to test for privilege escalation vulnerabilities. 
This typically involves checking access of all the higher-privilege APIs by a lower-privilege user. 
If any such API exists, then it's privilege should be fixed by the development team.

Akto enables you to do automate privilege escalation security tests. 
You can also use the information while creating Test YAML templates if you want to develop custom tests.
